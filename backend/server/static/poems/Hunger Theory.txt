parched & gaunt.
The restaurant closed two hours before.
We're offered drink,
	      only one only
	      method of payment tonight. 
Good, this is good:
	Now we're talking noise:
with 2 guts humming, 
	and all their butterflies poised
			for poems about excruciating
					purple painted nights. 
	"And who am I, your sunny sky?" she says.
	"No no, my Moon."
	"Your moon." A grating noise.
My nerves became an animal trapped inside a room.

"I'm so sorry to be
		better explained in Hunger Theory:
			TO CRAVE
		is to touch with phantom-tongue
				what this body needs most,
		a rush of blood to the head,
			and then to sleep,
			and then to wake,
		to crave another ghost,
		  and yet another.
	I'm haunted by my lust for you,
		can I say that, just to be clear?"
		And then on this smooth white promenade
		we come across a chaos
				of sea-birds
			glutting on a kill.
