Ana I want your mouth,
	muscle,
every morsel copper-red;
		dressed
in sunburnt umber//With Pluto as conjunct,
("the single space" you said, 
where your moon discovers horizon)

I've always wondered about you,
your passion for desolate planets,
where, theoretically speaking
there is no chance of life.
