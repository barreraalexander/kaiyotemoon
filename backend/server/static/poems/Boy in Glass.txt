moisture of mouth = 
juice.	But what fruit? Plum,
alien figure, 
		pale when slit
			subject
		of questions like what is it ? ?
	to a child, reaching--bemoans
	the pale-red parent, "don't play
	with that, don't you play
	--eat it, undiscovered." 

But what boy
--the only boy on earth--in backyard
in attempt to capture creatures//fleeing
	from tiny glass jars?
by nightfall:
breathless. The house has gone to sleep
it is dead or dormant? This body of an experiment
that you must allow to breathe.
