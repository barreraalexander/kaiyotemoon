Lost in dream
speech. Mute. Moon.
Orbiting around us, so many
furthers away.
Her name was Late-October.
She was cold on the outside.
And, when the sun would come
Should would vanish like the moon.
And I,
Warm in groping darkness
Under the farthest harvest moon
Glowing red,
like the end of the world:
I held you.
