Hazy through the daytime, 
We drink heavy after dinner. 
The meat was red as roses,
Potatoes lily white,
But no colors come to mind
for the whiskey; except excrete.

My lover made a mess of these occassions.
At high notes she hollers
		about beaches in the night,
		full moons ignited, 
	the rush of waves: a silver knife,
	And swelling, about a talk that we must have. 
What she will say is just a blur, a mere movement;
	like the body falling to bed. 
But not sleep. Just lying there, heart-rushed
And sick. A simple mess, with all our world
		spinning.
