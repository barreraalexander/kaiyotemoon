Little thimble
Of honey. Bees
Buzz loudest when burning
Which I so discovered.
On alcoholic afternoon
I swam with the salmon
Up the white river.
WetHeavyDarkGlistening
My world gleaming at the lashes
Oh when I emerged,
So cold in Secret Garden.
The Garden: where Deer
eat the rosebuds and bees
At guard do not give
Not a thimble of honey.
But Man,
I set the matches
Drew the ashes
Urning nectar. Just
To know the taste.
