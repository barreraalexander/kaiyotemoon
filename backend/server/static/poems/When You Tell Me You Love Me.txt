August meets December.
        The sugar-heavy apples,
    make graveyards of the orchard
    that we wander hand and hand through...
2 things are undoubtedly true:
    Those which have not been devoured
        have transitioned towards rotting;
    And the things that they prayed would ripen
                did.
