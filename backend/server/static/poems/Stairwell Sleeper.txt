	How do you sleep, Arielle
	on the stairwell?

	Amid night of pill-white moon
	I'd discover you: Raw red. Peeled back
	the blanket to find?
	A body,
		Instead:
			A shell for ghosts
	forcibly hatched. No wonder
	By noon you were always sleepy, 
	by midnight you were dead, but on stairway
			You waited
	For me to steal that hollow vessel
				off to shadow ridden
			Bed.
