	HEAVY.           Light bender
inhaler        of the cigarette smoke
after I told you, "we simply do it
for show, we simply--"

I don't know nor do I care to remember, 
the identity of the culprit,
of the conversation-ender
But end it we did, and early in the gloaming 
[I was walking through ammonia,
	(a night of myriad Nitrogen +
    soft-like-fluid Hydrogen)].
	Oh the sonant sun, it's guttural hum,
emitting atoms to clatter against me.
For it is a sky that won't stop leaking
red to save it's own life.
