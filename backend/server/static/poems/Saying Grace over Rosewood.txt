	You bid my bony body
	to the table where you feast.
		You clutch your mating call:
		a depth of silver knives.
	I am ate upon; I am scraped against. 
		A mouth, fiercely warm,
	cuts cold into stubbled peach,
	and the excess of the sweet 
		is absorbed into a napkin.

	I'm organizing myself
	into a well set table. My hunger
	is a sidedish, an over-soft apple,
	gushing at the squeeze.
		I am wearing the finest cloth,
	and a series of golden candles
		But my body, no
			my body,
			is too soft, too red
				to be rosewood.
