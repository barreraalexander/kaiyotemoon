we were spying fruit high we were
	dying for a bite; the sun drenched
salt boughs, dark from having been rained on
 were much like grasping fingers, 
			     arthritic in wait, in ache
	arthritic with age against weight
		 of natural 
		climbers. their fingers
			 drenched red, bark-bitten. 
			I called: "come down!"
		but then I was looked down upon.
		With mouths all nectar and glaze:
		they said I had always been afraid.
		
		I have always been afraid.
