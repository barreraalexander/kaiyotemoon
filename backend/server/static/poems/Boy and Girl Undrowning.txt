At Wolf Lake,
	on Overgrowth-Way,
	tromping the emeralds
to be grazed upon:
	A young couple (suffering
			   bovine-boredom)
	stroll along the throat
of a stream desiccated--Solemn,
		staring away:
	stupid,golden 	ducks
dunk their heads
	toward the lake bed.
	Against--to no avail,
		with chestplates hollow
 	they cannot pervade the surace.
