I'm on my raft 
	(or swells like a raft) 
buoyant atop	onyx tinged blue.

And when the day is over, I am nothing
					  but a child
					  in the world,
of a sky that is amber tinged womb.

But every night before I sleep,
	all the seagulls quit their hawking,
		and over the verge I peek,
		to the frozen heart of the deep,
			I see it:
		the shadows of colossi
			stalking.

Against terror, and without sleep,
	I row I row I wonder
		If I am to live alone:
		either on pastures gold
		or tesselate-oceans 
		will I ever escape the azure?
