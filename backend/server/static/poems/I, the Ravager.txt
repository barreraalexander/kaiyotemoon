Strawberry sky,

Strawberry sky,
	deadwind end of day,
	all of Summer's sweetness
is condensed into a hollow,
swallowed by honey suddenly,
	without cause:
	traffic stampedes a reckless mammal.
	After they pass
	ravagers
blitz the carcass for feasting.

Our lives are in need of this violence.
It's critical,
to remember. Who are we
to call the crows hollow?
For stripping flesh
	off negligent fauna,

As I watch them gather into a murder,
		alight
	to the temple-quiet oaks,
where crimson-glistened mouths
	croak to the skies for mating.
And that brings to mind
	us,
		our love-hungry lives
		with always another want
awaiting.
