Rain ran, The Sun-soar humbled
	Stilled. Blanketed by black.
My sweetie was 'neath the skeleton
		of Monastery awnings,
Running mostly laughing,
in a grocery bag she had.
    Moments before,
I was praying to the stones--
    so abstracted
    by the pitter-patter rain:
that only I felt her
when she asked if I was okay.

This apprehended I,
The vigorous raven-
	 sky, now stunned
by the crush and guttural hum,
			of thunderlight.
