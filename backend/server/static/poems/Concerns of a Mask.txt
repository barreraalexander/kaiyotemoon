Am I this,
    or the mask?

    At winters end,
A river abberates the path
        to crush
the leather shield of the roses
    that grew wild just too much.
Am I this, 
    or the mask?

When, as a boy, my father took me
    to a range of rushing horses, galloping
for no one to see.
    And how beautiful they'd hunt
muscles tight, torso gleaming for a flash:
    And we'd watch, taunted by sorrow:
    the painful beauty that they will die.
Am I this,
    or the mask?

Now, a job at the mall,
    Watching me,
The manikins eyes are pale,
    The collar bone of milk,
    it's fingers may grasp
        at nothing.
Am I this?
