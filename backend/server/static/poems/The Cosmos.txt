The television explains the cosmogony of planets,
then all of mankind, from cave to steel Capitol.
What vast wonders!--
    To ignore
As we're exploring each other,
swirling hot then hard,
  enacting our personal sequel 
        to the Procession of Planets:
        Occurring in a space,
Where stars are just another violent explosion,
    Daylight is a gravity's dance, The Earth
    a mere nothing. This Couch?
    Oh God. But we,
We are everything.
