On this night, sulfuric night:
		the body's muscles become shellfish,
		the philosophers:hunters,
		are colored luminant gold.

	They debate about meals, menus,
		yet...the morals of mammals in crates,
		but...their corn-fed pale fat,
		and yellow-jacket liver:
		it is the "mammal's resplendence".

		Hunters: where have gone
		The Bee-Keeper?
		The Farmer, their apricots?
		Has the sap sweet tooth
			of American mouth
		dried into ravagers of rot?
		Or is it just you and I?
			Yes, you and I 
			who have changed?
