 See a town,
    It's mighty church
    paint-peeled, surrendered to
        a drowning- - -static.
    You can't hear anything else.
        RAIN-CRASH-GLASS 
no no, you can't hear anything else, 

    The pathway's pavers
            are pummeled white,
            degraded.
            So you slosh,
            the rain's teeth gnaw 
                your pruned flesh,
            as you knock and plead
            against the answer
            that you are not recognized.
