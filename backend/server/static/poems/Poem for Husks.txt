Electric highwires,
    I'd like to see about jumping off them,
How they buzz and sting, overshadowing the bees. #replace overshadowing
No, this is not the valley,
    that treasures buried bits
        of when it used to be
           *when I used to be:

    Green as emeralds in the sunlight,
    by evening, Mother would paint me
        peroxide on the slashes,
        calamine on the rashes
    of Ivy; in the outskirts, growing wild
        counting tens--to tag and seek
only to end it   swatting flies--
    attracted to our over-warm,
                     over-rushing bodies--
    Now constructed, useful,
    power-field,
        Dark lines running long.
