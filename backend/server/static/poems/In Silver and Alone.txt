		Beneath rubies,
		in steel fleet:
		hominids are preserved.
Amid them, a rough psychotic
makes rounds with his salver,
		his cigarette mouth,
		his arms of bark, sunbruised maroon. 

At this hour the road emits heat.
You can see it, the oasis
	within the fumes and fractured color,
	within the gleam 
			of exhaust pipes
		more chrome than smoke-spume.
	New.

You can see it, the oasis of fumes and fractured color,
						in the gleam

						more chrome than smoke -spume.
