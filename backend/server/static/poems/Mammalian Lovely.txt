I was quoting the bible:
	"in bondage was born, 
	but soon will come that radiant--"
							crash.
							'rupt.
				Another transaction
		of metals/glass/body
on this very day of rest--now rush
	of fleshy rust. You can smell it,
			the body's silver:
	swum in street's gutter.

My Loretta is blazing blue. My Loretta,
					shall we continue? 
		our nostrils stench-filled
("I can't breathe. I can't--")
			we go. down
                town is like a fairytale.

We sit at The Clover Moon. Window:
	The Pink Clam across the road.
"how can you even think about that?"
"I don't know,
		I"  whispered.
"I can't even--hey, c'mon stop"

Sudden awareness: a mammal's hairy hand
			   is warring for her pale;
		       detached.  I let go.
"People died" she says.

I feel angry. Confused
by loving humanity.
