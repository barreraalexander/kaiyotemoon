At the face of it, we're mammals.
At our tongue
	lies lust. 
Why are nervous systems
so obsessed with tongues? Touching
	the taste of a lover's lung,
	or the earlobe,
	or the pill-pale
		navel,
fraught with sugar/saliva...
	This same tongue,
abused for talking,
	like a child in a church,
	desecrating The Sermon
	of The Aching Tooth.
It is a passion to be bit-upon,
	until you taste the metals
		rushing deep inside of you.
