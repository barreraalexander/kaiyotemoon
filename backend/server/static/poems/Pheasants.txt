Delilah, were we pheasants?
    You, Le Fontaine's duck,
And I, the sun-blind osprey?

    And if we are,
Do you remember the knife
         that was winter?
    How it slept upon iguanas--the stench.
There was a healthy sense of rot at the time,
like Paradise would run towards us,
            Restored.
And when it did we'd swim upon the glisten
        of the infamous Hourglass Lake--
    But the winter hails now, to this day,
the fields of grains have gone dry
--and I remember the knife that is winter,
   a gut filled
    by too-cruel appetites.
