I wake to the cricket's ensemble.
	A song of seeking: a love brood;
and wind blowing my white curtain, 
	while my sleep-heavy eyes,
		make ghosts of it.

I try to sleep but I see them:
	those bugs, their bone-made bellies,
		like a mammal's rib-cage exposed,
			a window
				to a heaving organ.
				
		While the raven plots on powerlines
				gleaming lustrous
			&ruffling her feathers
		Licks itself cool
			then floats away,
	That I may sleep once again.
