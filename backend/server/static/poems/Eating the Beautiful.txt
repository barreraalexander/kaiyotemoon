The bugs are eating The || bugs are eating the Tremendous sun is trembling the
trouble is not within me.
	
	It's my shadow, eating
	  caffeine/green plain,
	a loutish crunch, of 2 engineers
swallowing a landscape.
	We are in search, in Eve's-apple-search,
	 || a trouble that's not within me ||
	     for a shady place, safe.

When the bread comes out,  I'm asked which
	         [loudish, loutish]
	are we starting jam-red or yellow or
	       [rotted, yellowing
conscious of decay] of lack of rain on caffeine plain
when you are merely asking for marmalade,
honey, tremendous trembling heaps. 
	You're always wanting 
  sweet.
