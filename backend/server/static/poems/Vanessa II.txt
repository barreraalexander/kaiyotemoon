My love, as I write this you are sleeping.
	Have you ever,     I ask you
been shook awake at 4, completely lost.
	Moonlight slices
my pallid skin, my ankle-protruding
	a bone so obtuse, Is it the angle? You wonder.
					  Is it the hour?
	Is it the stupor of fresh sleep,
		a veil, under which,
		I become so alien to you?
