Brush back the fig leaf.
    See lovers
        nudists
        neutered:
Fatal-struck the Seraph,
with it's flaming horizon.
    Now lovers are floating vagrants, 
    Engulfed by Giant's shadow.
    The only thing they could feed it
        are the hours
           spent awash
        as stones-gleaming-brook.
    But voracious is that Seraph,
        for the sweet of lemons forsook,
    as voracious are their hearts,
        for another wanting second.
