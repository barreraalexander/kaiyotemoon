Maple tree tongues
		are caught
		on-fire red. 
Their crackling noises rush
		to the dead-ends.
And our cul-de-sac's sequoia
		Is eating itself hollow. 
		
God I hate it so much,
	When all of this life
		slumbers,
And every bird with its bird songs
		are swallowed. 
		
I cannot admit, but I must:
That all my days in heaven,
Have been torrential summer rain dance
    So I'm weak at the sight& oblivion-quiet 
	Of autumn's hunger.
